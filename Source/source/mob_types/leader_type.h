 * A type of leader. The "leader" class is a mob, so the walking Olimar,
 * walking Louie, etc. This leader type is actually the definition of
 * what the leader is like. Maybe this will be clearer:
 * The same way you have enemies and enemy types, you can have more
 * than one leader on the map that is of the same leader type;
 * this means you can have 3 Olimars, if you want.
 * Why would you do that, though?
