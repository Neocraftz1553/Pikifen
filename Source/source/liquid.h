 * A liquid type defines how a sector should look to make it look like water.
 * This is considered a "liquid" and not specifically "water" because the
 * engine allows creating other water-like things, like acid, lava, etc.
 * Each have their own color, reflectivity, etc.
 * A hazard can be associated with a liquid. It's the way the
 * engine has to know if a sector is to be shown as a liquid or not.
