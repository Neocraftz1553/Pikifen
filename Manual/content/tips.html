    <p>Here are some tips for the engine!</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>To drop a held Pikmin without throwing it, keep the throw button held, and press the whistle button.</li>
      <li>If you dismiss while swarming in a certain direction, the group will be dismissed in that direction.</li>
      <li>Your Pikmin actually have health. Though it slowly goes back up on its own, Pikmin that have been recently burned, poisoned, etc. will survive for less time if it happens again!</li>
      <li>If you're having trouble understanding why your custom mob is acting the way it is, try enabling the <a href="maker_toolkit.html">maker tools</a>, aiming your cursor at it and using the "mob info" maker tool (5 key, by default).</li>
      <li>See <a href="area_tips.html">area tips</a> for tips on how to make good areas.</li>
