    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    
    <p>Got a question about the engine? You may find the answer here! If your question is a problem, please check the <a href="troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting page</a> instead.</p>

    <dd>
      <dt><b>What is there left to do?</b></dt>
      <dd>It's hard to say, but the Pikmin Fanon page has a rough roadmap.</dd>

      <dt><b>If the engine is just meant to be the game's logic, why does it come with so many enemies, graphics, etc.?</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Having some content to play with means people can try the engine and its features right out of the box, without having to download or create content.</li>
          <li>The existing content serves as a basis for new content. If you're having trouble placing a bridge, just see how the included areas do it. If you want to create an Orange Bulborb, just copy the Red Bulborb and recolor it. And so on.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Why do some enemies act a bit differently from how they do in the canon games?</b></dt>
      <dd>It could either be an engine limitation (since <i>Pikifen</i> isn't as complex as a Nintendo product), or it could've been a change I made on purpose. The engine's content isn't meant to mirror the canon content exactly, and sometimes, I make slight changes to features and content because it's needed in order to be more readable in a top-down format, because I think it will make for a funner, fairer experience, etc.</dd>

      <dt><b>Why are the animations so clunky and the graphics so simple?</b></dt>
      <dd>I'm not an artist! Since nobody else is doing the graphics, I did the best I could.</dd>

      <dt><b>Why are the textures and HUD all shiny and realistic, but the objects are simplistic?</b></dt>
      <dd>It's the style choice I went with for the packaged content, but anybody can style the textures, HUD, and objects in any way they want.</dd>
      <dd>In my opinion, Pikmin games have always looked fairly realistic. The engine can achieve pretty environments too, so making the textures simplistic would steal quite a lot of beauty.</dd>
      <dd>The objects are simple, and based off of vector graphics, so it's easier to edit their graphics. If they were screenshots of 3D models, that would require content creators to have or create models for their new enemies, just so they could take screenshots in order to follow the pre-packaged content's style.</dd>
      <dd>An alternative style that could maybe work all around is pixel art for everything, but I haven't tried it.</dd>

      <dt><b>Why didn't you use textures and sounds from the <i>Pikmin</i> games?</b></dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>The less copyrighted content I use, the safer I am, even if minimally. There's a difference between "code some fan made from scratch" and "a repository of Nintendo's copyrighted assets right there for the taking".</li>
          <li>Should something happen to the engine, I can rebrand it, and release the assets as they are, since they are my creations.</li>
          <li>If somebody wants to add a sound effect from the series, at best, it can be a bit cumbersome to obtain, and at worst, it can be downright impossible (depends on the game and the sound). But if all sounds are custom-made, this isn't really a problem. This applies to textures and such as well, to a lesser degree.</li>
          <li>It doesn't really matter anyway because what is included with the engine is demo content; users are meant to use whatever assets they please.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><b>Why 2D?</b></dt>
      <dd>3D would be MUCH harder for me to develop, and for players to create content for. You can get something convincing with 2D alone.</dd>

      <dt><b>Will you ever add X?</b></dt>
      <dd>Depends. If it's an area or enemy or something, the content creators are meant to do that, not me. Though I might still add it for the sake of demonstration. But if it's something like a feature, ask me!</dd>

      <dt><b>Why do some updates make previously created content incompatible for such small reasons?</b></dt>
      <dd>I believe that making the way things work, are organized, are named, etc. consistent is the key to understanding the engine.</dd>
      <dd>If I give a feature a certain name, but later on, rework it and figure out a better name for it, I will rename it (and break some compatibilities in the process), because I want the feature to be intuitive. If it kept the old name, it would confuse newcomers.</dd>
      <dd>I don't like making content incompatible, but I think it's a small price to pay for the sake of making everyone able to juice the most out of the engine.</dd>

      <dt><b>Why are some features so customizable and others so strict?</b></dt>
      <dd>It's very hard to balance responsibility and power when creating a feature.</dd>
      <dd>I want to give the developer as much power as possible, but that also increases the developer's responsibility to learn how the feature works in detail, and how to use it properly. To try to make it easy for anyone to create content, I have to lower the responsibility and power of some features.</dd>

      <dt><b>Is it possible to add Winged Pikmin?</b></dt>
      <dd>Unlikely... First, their airborne state would be a nightmare to code in with the currently existing finite-state-machine logic.</dd>
      <dd>Secondly, it's very difficult to convey height in a top-down game as-is, so creating a Pikmin type that has height as its main mechanic wouldn't work well at all.</dd>
