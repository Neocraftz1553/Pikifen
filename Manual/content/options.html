    <h1>Options</h1>
    
    <p>The following is an explanation of the player options in <i>Pikifen</i>.</p>

    <p>The resolution and fullscreen options can be set in the options menu. The controls can be changed in a sub-menu, and the defaults are listed on <a href="https://github.com/Espyo/Pikifen/blob/master/README.txt">the included README.txt file</a>. The rest of the options can be set in the <code>/User_data/Options.txt</code> file, but since these don't have a large impact for most fans, there is no way to edit them in the options menu. The following options (besides controls) can be found in that text file:</p>

    <table>

        <td>If false, the faint trail that follows the cursor will be removed, which could help with performance.</td>
